Add your ActiveRecord models here.

You can create them by being in the application root directory and running, e.g.,

rake generate:model NAME=User

Images are saved in the /public folder

Partials: I just rendered the Yak! partial. Whoa. So, there you have it: you don't just use
AJAX to use partials. You don't even need to specify layout => false! Crazy.

The app does not break without AJAX. I did change the code and then the 
whole page was inserted (appended) into that slot (line 11 on index.erb)
You end up appending the whole page where the image
of the die is supposed to go.

If there is no JavaScript function, the page simply re-loads with the new die image.

validates inclusion is an interesting statement. Here it is:

validates :value, :inclusion => { :in => (1..6), :message => "Must be between 1 and 6" } 

it validates an attribute, value, then there is a key-value pair, where the value is a hash
of two key-value pairs. Validates inclusion means that value includes the stuff in the value
end of the key-value pair.

What's happening in the JavaScript?
